I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in empirical industrial organization and competition economics. My research focuses on how firms make strategic decisions—such as entry, location choice, and product assortment—and how these choices shape market outcomes and consumer welfare.

My recent work explores assortment strategies under uniform pricing in the retail industry. In other projects, I study how firms use non-compete clauses to deter entry of their competitors, and the role of private information in firms' entry decisions. In the grocery retail industry, I study nutritional differences between private label and branded products, and the strategic use of left-digit bias in firm pricing.
